Though there is little critical work Jcvotcd to the t-itudy of opening credits, they He arguahly one uf the most importanl st:•gments of the text, hoth in film and on television, because they are the first imagt's the viewer ennnmtt·rs. The original purpose of a film's opening credits was mo.stly utilitarian (i.e. ro "credit" all of the individuab whn conrrihuted to the production of the film), and so it is not surprising that sry·lc, usually plain typography over a still image, reflectt•d function (Haskin 10). By the ]l))Os, filmmakers were beginning ro realize that they could use this ohli.Q"atory se.L('ment in service of the film as a whole-to :-;et up the film\ overall ur prnvide a pwlogue forth(.: narr;.uive, or establish a mood.1<br>
Until recently, L'S television credits also served a simple function, namely to introduce the show\ and gue:-;t :-;tar:-;, usually again.-,t the hu.:kdrnp of :1 few images n:prcscntative of the series. The credit ..-equences which open Friends (1994-2004) and The Co.,hy Slum (1984-1992), t(Jr instanct::, have their pri1nary Gbt members dancing in various locations ;1s the .show's theme song plays, while The Sotmmas' (]999-) opening credits depict Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) drh·ing through Nt.'w Jersey, past iDcatiuns which feature prominently in the series.' While rhcse segments certainly work to establish a mood for the prl)gram which tdlows, the images we see are primarily lifted from rhe diegt·sis of l'.t::rks. In <br>
however, the opening creLlits to acclaimed television serie.-,, including VcaJteood (2004-), Vcspcmtc (2004-), flousc (2004-) and )ix Feet
Under (2001-2005), among others, have replaced this traditional format with a sequence of disconnected, "dreamlike" images that are more "generic!' than specific, more connotative than denotative. These credit sequences clearly borrow their stylistic cues from music videos, which employ chains of disparate images that stress discontinuities in time and space to evoke abstract concepts (Kinder 3).<br>
HBO's Deadwood is a prime example of how opening credits can set up the broader themes, concerns and narrative goals of a television series. Rather than editing together shots of the series' main characters along with images from the 1876 settlement of Deadwood, Deadwood's opening credits combine a chain of generic, often highly abstract images of life out West: a wagon wheel pushing through the mud, a block of ice splashed with the blood of freshly slaughtered meat, fingers raking through a pan of pay dirt in search of gold, a prospector pulling a rotten tooth from his mouth, a buxom woman sinking into a tub of water, and so on.<br>
These images are intended as l1ursts of instantly recognizable, multilayered
meanings, culled from almost two hundred years of Western tradition, both in print and on film. The close-up of a wooden wheel, for example, acts as both a metonym for the covered wagon, as well as the great Westward migration of the 1800s in general. This simple image represents the arduous journey made by Eastern adventurers as they sought a new life in the West.3 Likewise, the scruffY man who inspects and then disposes of his rooth serves as visual shorthand for the prospector's mentality. During the first years of the gold rush, when a man could uncover incalculable fortunes at any moment, a rotten tooth is of little consequence. His face, creased from hard prairie living and toiling in the sun, is that of a man intent on striking the bonanza he knows must surely be waiting for him in the next pan of pay dirt. Finally, the image of the bathing woman, drawn in a few bold strokes, conveys a wealth of information to the viewer. "Proper" Eastern ladies, as we are told in Westerns like Stagecoach Oohn Ford, 1939), My Darling Clementine (Ford, 1946), and The Harvey Girls (George Sidney, 1946), wear dark suits, high, starched white collars and tight corsets. These women, who represent culture, education and domesticity, have difficulty understanding the Western hero's "uncivilized" way oflife,4 and· as a result, spend much of their screen time attempting to "Easternize" him. In contrast, the bathing woman's nudity, griminess and lack of modesty (we can see men milling around her
   open door} point to her status as a prostitute, a woman who understands<br>
and embraces the Western mentality. Though we only see this woman from behind, the simple act of sinking into the tub, presumably after a long day's "work," illustrates the weariness that comes with her independence from the feminine codes of the East. As Robert Warshow explains in his seminal essay "Movie Chronicle: The Westerner" (1954), "nobody owns (the prostitute], nothing has to be explained to her, and she is not, like a virtuous woman, a 'value' that demands to be protected" (108).
Beyond providing the viewer with a glimpse into the difficult, dirty living conditions of life in the Old West, this opening sequence aLso efficiently establishes the central syntax of the Western genre, namely the archetypal struggle between civilization and savagery. As numerous film scholars have noted, the Western (and all film genres for that matter) revolves around a binary opposition reflecting an irresolvable contradiction entrenched within the American psyche. Each new entry in the genre represents another attempt to negotiate and resolve the particular cultural conflict generated by these opposing forces.<br>
In Hollywood Genres (1981), Thomas Schatz explains that "In addressing basic cultural conflicts and celebrating the values and attitudes whereby these conflicts might be resolved, all film genres represent the filmmakers' and audience's cooperative effort." to 1tame' those beasts ... which threaten the stability of our everyday lives" (29). Thus, a particular genre's longevity is often a sign that its conflict is of fundamental social interest-that both sides are appealing. While we demand, on the one band, the establishment of law, order and democratic regulation in order to build a stable wciety, we also chafe against these restrictions and lung for the anarchy, independence and freedom associated with America's frontier days.<br>
These two sides of the Western's central conflict can be represented by
numerous antimonies: East versus West, government versus self rule, white man versus Indian,5 lady or schoolmarm versus prostitute, homesteader versus rancher, garden versus wilderness, compromise versus integrity, etc. (Belton 254-5). As an example of a "genre of order" (Schatz 35), the Western resolves its central conflict through the violent elimination of one side of this binary, rather than through the integration of these opposing forces.6 In the Western, it is almost always the savage side of the conflict, typically embodied in the character(s) of an outlaw, a hostile Indian tribe, or an entire<br>
depraved community, which must be eliminated in order to make way for the establishment of social order.
Indeed, it is because of this ability to address social conflicts and then resolve them in simplistic ways that genre films are thought by many critics to be structures through which dominant ideologies flow. In her article "Genre Films and the Status Quo" (1986), judith Hess Wright examines the way in which enduring American film genres, namely the Western, the science fiction film, the horror film, and the gangster film, help to reinforce the status quo by uproduc[ing) satisfaction rather than action, pity and fear rather than revolt" (41). In other words, if social conflicts are given a satisfactory solution, audiences are pacified and, consequently, deterred from the desire for social change. For this reason, Wright argues, genre films almost always conclude with a of the status quo.
Having the Western conclude with the triumph of civilization over savagery, culture over nature, and democracy over solipsism, allows audiences to continually work through and thus "naturalize" the violence of Manifest Destiny (Schatz 47). john Belton, author of American Cinema/American Culture (2005), supports this theory:
Ever since the closing of the frontier and the disappearance of the old West, contemporary American audiences have needed the Western to provide them with a mythical, quasi-utopian past in which they are empowered as individuals and hecorne members of a society whose values and beliefs are roott.·d in the stable realities of the land itself.<br>
The Western thus implies that, while the Westward expansion was a violent process, this violence was ultimately justified. The true Western hero, as we are frequently reminded, never draws first, though he always draws the quickest.
Of course, many Westerns, particularly those released in the 1960s and 1970s when the concepts of "civilization" and "progress" began to lose their sparkle-The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (john Ford, 1962) and Ride the High Country (Sam Peckinpah, 1962)-also lament this transformation of wilderness into garden. However, even these Westerns, which are nostalgic for the disappearance of the American frontier, admit that its eradication is/was inevitable and necessary. In fact, such a perspective is built into the<br><br>
genre: in 1893, two years before the invention of the cinema, Frederick Jackson Turner declared, in a famous speech entitled "The Significance of the Frontier in American History," that the Western frontier was officially "closed." Consequently, "ltlhe birth of the Western film was inextricably hound up with the death of the West" (Belton 250). Every Western, whether on film or television, has been made in the aftermath of this "death," and is therefore always an attempt to justifY, negotiate and/or understand the birth
of America and the American character.<br>
<br>covered wagons are all entities that brought "civilization" to the West or are the result of the arrival of civilization. Indeed, these images move in an almost chronological fashion-from the first wagon trains and prospectors, to the arrival of the women who keep said prospectors happy, to the establishment of businesses (signified by the image of a butcher reaching for a chicken in a wicker cage). Each represents a new, more enduring sign that the white man from the East has set up its claim on the West. The final images of the sequence are, significantly, all filmed indoors, indicating that permanent buildings, as opposed to tents, have been erected in Deadwood. We see a hand of poker, a line of shot glasses awaiting liquor on a gleaming mahogany bar, and a brass scale weighing a pile of fine gold dust. The existence of these spaces of leisure points to the establishmenr of a permanent civilization in the West.
This Western iconography, particularly the images of prospectors and
prostitutes, can also represent the savage side of the Western binary, hut only when opposed with a more obvious signifier of civilization such as the Eastern tenderfoot or the schoolmarm. Along the same lines, the aforementioned images only denote civilization when opposed with a clear signifier of savagery or wilderness, which is why, in the opening credits, they are repeatedly interrupted with shots of an unbridled horse, a classic symbol of the uncontainable frontier spirit, running through the landscape.7<br>
It is important that rhese shots maintain a consistent screen direction (right to left and/or background to foreground) because it implies that this horse is running screen left, towards the wilderness of the West and away from the civilization of the East. Each time the viewer is confronted with an image of permanence, the camera cuts to the same horse, running, but always against a new background. In other words, the horse is continually fleeing
   98
the confines of law, order and community, only to find that civilization keeps catching up with him. This push and pull between wilderness and civilization ls integrated into one shot towards the end of the sequence, when the horse runs through a makeshift prospector camp on the banks of a river. In attempting to flee society, the horse finds that he has run straight into it. There is nowhere left for him to run.8
The final shot of this opening sequence, of the horse coming to a stop in the settlement of Deadwood, is the most important thematically because it is the first specific image to be taken from the series itself (as opposed to the previous generic images of wheels and faceless women). Having the horse end its journey in the location where the series is based and then disappear creates the impression that the settlement of Deadwood marks the final disappearance of the frontier. Westward expansion is over, the wilderness is gone, and the white man is here to stay.9 The reason we know that this final shot is filmed in Deadwood is because in a puddle by the horse's feet we see the distorted reflection of the Gem.
This brothel and saloon, owned by AI Swearengen, is a locus for the town's
criminal elements, a place where men can revel in the most depraved forms
of civilization. Within its wooden walls dope is purchased and distributed, women are sold and abused, and men arc shot, stabbed, and impaled on deer antlers for offences big and small. ''Civilization" has arrived in the West, this final shot implies, but it is hardly the civilization with which America wishes to identify itself. In fact, the civilization residing in the Gem, and Deadwood as a whole, can hardly be differentiated from the savagery it has supposedly replaced for the good of the community.<br>
Here we can see how the carefully selected images of Deadwood's opening credits provide, within a few minutes, the thematic progression of the classic film Western. Much like a shootout at high noon, these images represent the battle between the forces of civilization and savagery that are constantly at play in the Western. Of course, Deadwood is not a classic film Western; it is an HBO series. And as viewers know from previous with programs created by that cable powerhouse, such as The Sopranos (1999-) and The Wire (2002-), HBO can never simply present a straightforward account of a seemingly straightforward genre.10 Deadwood's vision of the Western relies on the ambiguity, or perhaps even the impossibility, of morality and values over the traditional and more digestible binary oppositions of the classic
   film Western.11 The opening credits foreground this opposition between civilization and savagery precisely because these concepts do not appear as oppositions within the series itself. They are, rather, the twin faces of America, past and present. Every episode of Deadwood opens with this "prehistory," this shorthand of the genre's central concerns, in order to further highlight the series' own deviance from the classic Western modeL
Simply put, Deadwood is different from its televisual and even its filmic predecessors because it does not work to disavow what the viewer knows to be true-that the differences between civilization and savagery, which the Western labors to establish, are nonexistent. Robert Warshow argues that this generic disavowal is one possible explanation for the enduring appeal of the Western: "One of the well-known peculiarities of modern civilized opinion is its refusal to acknowledge the value of violence. This refusal is a virtue, but like many virtues it involves a certain willful blindness and it encourages hypocrisy" (121). In fact, one of the truisms of the Western is that progress, civilization, and, by extension, the creation of America, was only possible through the establishment of laws and government and the elimination of criminaliry and anarchy. This syntax is necessary in order to justify the American myth oforigins and to rationalize capitalist development.
Since Turner delivered his turn-of-the-century lecture on the American
frontier spirit, filmmakers and audiences have used the genre to romanticize
and legitimize the nation's cruel and violent history (Saunders 6). <br>Therefore,
to deny the differences between civilization and savagery, to argue that these Labels are arbitrary and imposed from without, is, in effect, to deny the nobility of America's mythologized past as well as its present. Deadwood implies not only that our present civilization was built on a foundation of savagery, but also that there was never a difference between the two in the first place. As Sol Star explains to his partner, Seth Bullock, who has reservations about using Swearengen's capital to back their banking venntre, "If money had to he clean before it was recirculated we'd still be living in fucking caves" ("Requiem for a Gleet," 2.4).
Indeed, that the settlement of Deadwood exists at all is primarily the result of AI Swearengen, the series' unquestioned hero, and his abiliry to understand the symbiotic relationship between civilization and savagery and the necessity of violence in the past to the erection of the American democracy and capitalism we celebrate in the present. It is therefore fitting
that Season Two concludes with Mr. Wu, who has just slaughtered all of his business rivals, cutting off his queue (a marker of his ethnic difference) and pronouncing to Swearengen, "Wu! America!" Recognizing Wu's meaning, that violence begets progress and ensures the future of a burgeoning nation, Swearengen smiles and assures him, "That'll hold you tight to her tit" ("Boy the Earth Talks To").
In his oft-quoted essay "Theses on the Philosophy of History" (1940),
Walter Benjamin ruminates on the process by which history is understood
and recorded. He points out that the past is regularly deployed as a
justification for the present, that "[t]here is a secret agreement between past
generations and the present one. Our coming was expected on earth" (254). The history of Westward expansion, as told by the Western, in print, in the cinema and on television, is that this expansion was inevitable, necessary, and justified. We see the violence of our past and the civilization of our present and conclude that one eradicated the other, and for the better. The secret of the Western, continuously disavowed in text after text, is that there is no difference between civilization and savagery-civilization is savage. As Benjamin argues later in the same essay, "There is no document of civilization wbich is not at the same time a document of barbarism" (256). Deadwood is one of the few Westerns to come to terms with the implications of this statement, that American society was built upon a foundation of inhumanity and bloodshed. In Deadwood this history, unlike the murdered corpses digesting in the bellies of Mr. Wu's hungry pigs, is left out in the open to bloat and decay before our eyes. The opening credits to Deadwood work to establish the supposed opposition and separation between civilization and savagery in order to prepare the viewer for a series that complicates and questions an period of American histor <br>
