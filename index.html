         <p>A frame is where content is contained, it can be compared to the roll of a designer. How something is framed can also alter the perception of its content when viewed.</p>

         <p>In Michael Rock's <strong> Fuck Content essay </strong>, he examines the roles of design and the designer, and justifies design as a content just as substantial and influential as other kinds of content, like writing and art. I wanted to create a reader that would highlight design itself as the designer's content, which lead me to the idea of <i>frames.</i> <br>

         <strong> Derrida on Parergon </strong> is about viewing the frame as a parergon and how it is <i>critical</i> in expanding our everyday understanding of what a frame is, as well as defining its relationship with a painting. <br>

        <strong>The Horse Doesn’t Get A Credit</strong> is about the design of title sequences and how they are used as frames for movies. <br><br>
