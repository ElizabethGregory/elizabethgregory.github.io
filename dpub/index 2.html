<strong> Article One: Fuck Content </strong>
<br>
<p>Designers also trade in <strong>storytelling</strong>. The elements we must master are not the content
narratives but the devices of the telling: typography, line, form, color, contrast, scale,
weight. We speak through our assignment, literally between the lines.
The span of graphic design is not a history of concepts but of forms. Form has evolved
dramatically from one year to the next, and suggests a profession that continually
revises and reshapes the world through the way it is rendered. Stellar examples of
graphic design, design that changes the way we look at the world, are often found in
service of the most mundane content: an ad for ink, cigarettes, sparkplugs or
machinery. Think of Piet Zwart's catalogues for electrical cable; or the travel posters of
Cassandre or Matter; or the New Wave work of Weingart, Greiman and Freidman; or
the punk incitations of Jamie Reid, in which the manipulation of form has an essential,
even transformative, meaning.</p>
<p>At a 1962 conference at the Museum of Modern Art, conservative art critic Hilton
Kramer denounced Pop Art as "indistinguishable from <strong>advertising</strong> art" because "Pop Art
does not tell us what it feels like to be living through the present moment of civilization.
Its social effect is simply to reconcile us to a world of commodities, banalities and
vulgarities." But perhaps the content of graphic design is exactly that: an evocation of
"what it feels like to be living through the present moment of civilization," with all its
"commodities, banalities and vulgarities." How else can we discuss the content of a
typeface or why the typography of a surfing magazine suddenly becomes relevant? Or
how a series of made-up or 'self-initiated' posters—already a medium of dubious
functionality— can end up on the wall of a major design museum? Work must be saying
something, which is different than being about something.</p>

<strong> Article Two: <span class="story">story</span> Telling </strong>
<p>Today, storytelling is wildly popular. It’s seen as the key to succeeding in business, strengthening organisational culture, and drumming up support for advocacy and campaigns. But why is that? The first reason is obvious: climate change, inequality, violence and other challenges can’t be solved by doing more of the same. We need new narratives that connect with people’s deepest motivations and promote more radical action. Stories engage people at every level – not just in their minds but in their emotions, values and imaginations, which are the drivers of real change. So if we want to transform society, we must learn to tell – and listen to – a new set of stories about the world we want to create.</p>
<p>Business is only now learning that telling a good <span class="story">story</span> requires authenticity, as if bewildered by the discovery of truth. <span class="story">story</span>telling in social movements is more advanced. In fact for those who work for social justice, the problem has not been making up good stories, but getting people to listen to the ones they have already. This can be especially hard when movements are very broad, and when the issues they deal with are so large in scope. But my <span class="story">story</span>telling sessions taught me another lesson that’s useful in this context: even when the issues are large and complex, we feel compelled to listen when we ourselves are included in the storyline.</p>

<strong> Article Three: Advertising </strong>
<p>It is difficult, as a person who has grown up surrounded by advertisements in magazines, on television and on the internet, to discern where I begin and where advertising ends. I have began to ask the question lately: how many of my aspirations, feelings and ideas have sprung up truly from my own mind, and how many have been planted there by the images and words I have consumed throughout my life?</p>

<p>Advertising plays a crucial role in todays society, more than it ever has before. There is not just an importance placed on objects as products, but as yourself as a product. From applying to University when I wrote a personal statement that would ‘sell’ me as a person worthy of a place, to writing my CV, to creating a blog or changing my cover photo on Facebook - all of these things are a type of advertising used to advertise myself and they affect how others will see me.</p>

<p>On a surface level, good advertising ignites our interest and makes us want to learn more about or buy a product. But what about the role advertising plays on a more subconscious level, that we are not always aware of?</p>

<p>It is difficult when you are consistently bombarded with images to really notice any of them - as a society we have become almost immune to shock or surprise. Anti smoking adverts on television and safe sex campaigns on Spotify, for example, confront us with shocking, off-putting images or stories that aim to change the way we live our lives. Although it may not stop us from having that cigarette on a night out or make us monks, an image says a thousand words and, if done well, the message will stick in our heads.</p>
