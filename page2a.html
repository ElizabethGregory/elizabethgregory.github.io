Thus, the drapery on statues, a privileged example, would function as parergon, as
ornamentation. This means (das heisst) precisely what is not interior or intrinsic
(innerlich), in the sense of an integral component (als Bestandstiick), to the
complete representation of the object (in die ganze Vorstellung des Gegenstandes),
but which belongs to it only in an extrinsic fashion (nur iusserlich), as a surplus,
an addition, an adjunct (als Zuthat).
OCTOBER
The drapery on statues, which simultaneously adorns and veils their nudity,
is hors d'oeuvre clinging to the work's edges as to the body represented, but-so
the argument goes-not a part of the representative whole. What is represented by
the representation is the nude body, au naturel; the representational essence of the
statue tallies with it; and only in it may the representation be beautifulessentially,
purely, and intrinsically beautiful, "the proper object of a pure
judgement of taste."
This definition of the center and of the integrity of the representation, of its
inside and outside, may already appear peculiar. We may ask as well where the
drapery begins. Where a parergon begins, and where it ends. Whether all drapery
is parergon-G-strings and the like. What to do with absolutely transparent veils.
And how to transpose the statement to painting. For example, Cranach's Lucretia
holds nothing but a flimsy transparent veil over her sex: where is the parergon?
Must we also consider a parergon-not part of her nude body, au naturel-the
dagger which she points at herself and which touches her skin (only the point of
the parergon touches her body, in the middle of a triangle formed by her two
breasts and her navel)? Is her necklace also a parergon? It concerns the objectifying,
representational essence, its inside and outside, the criteria used in this
definition, the value attributed to the natural, and, either secondarily or principally,
the privileged position of the human body. If every parergon is added, as
proved in Religion, only because of a lack within the system it augments, then
what deficiency in the representation of the body does drapery supplement? And
what has art to do with it?
Our surprise at this paragraph has only begun. (Parergon also signifies the
exceptional, the peculiar, the extraordinary.) I have somewhat too hastily torn
"drapery" from the context of three examples, three parerga which are no less
strange-first in themselves, and in relation to one another. The example which
follows immediately is that of the colonnades of palaces (Siulenginge um
Prachtbdude). These columns are also supplementary parerga. After drapery, the
column. Why should the column be external to the edifice? According to what
criterion, what critical organ, what organon of discernment? It is no less obscure
than in the preceding case and presents yet another difficulty: in this case the
parergon augments a work which represents nothing and which itself augments
nature. We believe we know what is part and what is not part of the human body,
what may be detached from it and what may not-even if the parergon is precisely
a detachment which is not easily detached. But in an architectural work, the
Vorstellung, the representation, is not structurally representational-or it is, but
according to a detour so complicated that it would undoubtedly disconcert anyone
who wanted to distinguish, in a critical manner, the inside from the outside, the
integral from the detachable. So as not to complicate this even further, I set aside,
provisionally, columns in the form of the human body supporting or representing
the support of a window (and the window itself-is it part of the edifice? And a
window in a painting of a building?), and which may be nude or draped and may
represent either a man or a woman-a distinction to which Kant does not allude.

OCTOBER
With the example of the colonnade, we encounter the entire problematic of
inscription in a milieu, of distinguishing the work from a ground. It is always
difficult to determine whether the ground is natural or artificial and, in the latter
case, whether it is parergon or ergon. The ground, even if it is contiguous with the
work, does not constitute a parergon in the Kantian sense. The natural site chosen
for the erection of a temple is obviously not a parergon. Nor is an artificial site:
neither the square, nor the church, nor the museum, nor the other surrounding
works. But drapery or the column, yes. Why? Not because they are easily detached;
on the contrary, they are very difficult to detach. Without them, without their
quasidetachment, the lack within the work would appear or, what amounts to the
same, would not appear. It is not simply their exteriority that constitutes them as
parerga, but the internal structural link by which they are inseparable from a lack
within the ergon. And this lack makes for the very unity of the ergon. Without it,
the ergon would have no need of a parergon. The lack of the ergon is the lack of a
parergon, of drapery or columns which nevertheless remain exterior to it. How do
we determine the role of energeia?
May we attach the third example to this series of examples, to the question
which they raise? The third is in fact the first-I have proceeded in reverse. It is, at
least apparently, difficult to associate with the other two. It is the frames of
paintings (Einfassungen der Gemilde). The frame: parergon like the others. This
series may be surprising. How do we assimilate the function of the frame to that of
drapery on (in, around, or against) sculpture, and to that of columns surrounding
an edifice? And what about a frame which frames a painting representing a
building surrounded by columns in the form of draped human figures? The
incomprehensibility of the border, at the border, appears not only at the inner
limit, between the frame and the painting, the drapery and the body, the column
and the building, but also at its outer limit. Parerga have a thickness, a surface
which separates them not only, as Kant would have it, from the body of the ergon
itself, but also from the outside, from the wall on which the painting is hung, the
space in which the statue or column stands, as well as from the entire historic,
economic, and political field of inscription in which the drive of the signature
arises (an analogous problem, as we will see later). No "theory," no "practice," no
"theoretical practice" can be effective here if it does not rest on the frame, the
invisible limit of (between) the interiority of meaning (protected by the entire
hermeneutic, semiotic, phenomenological, and formalist tradition) and (of) all the
extrinsic empiricals which, blind and illiterate, dodge the question.
The parergon is distinguished from both the ergon (the work) and the
milieu; it is distinguished as a figure against a ground. But it is not distinguished
in the same way as the work, which is also distinguished from a ground. The
parergonal frame is distinguished from two grounds, but in relation to each of
these, it disappears into the other. In relation to the work, which may function as
its ground, it disappears into the wall and then, by degrees, into the general
context. In relation to the general context, it disappears into the work.

OCTOBER
form on a ground, the parergon is nevertheless a form which has traditionally
been determined not by distinguishing itself, but by disappearing, sinking in,
obliterating itself, dissolving just as it expends its greatest energy. The frame is
never a ground in the way the context or the work may be, but neither does its
marginal thickness form a figure. At least, it is a figure which arises of its own
accord.
What would Kant have said about a frame which frames a painting
representing a building surrounded by columns (there are many examples) in the
form of the draped human figure (the frescoes in the vault of the Sistine Chapelwhat
is their frame?-are paintings in which the represented, painted object is
sculpture which itself represents, at Jonah's right for example, putti which form a
column supporting a ceiling, etc. The same applies to the Persian sibyl, to
Zachariah, who holds a book in his hand, to Jeremiah, and to the Libyan sibyl; it
is hard to say whether these putti-columns are draped or not; they support
drapery), and which is set on an easel-the whole thing represented in another
painting.
I may appear to be taking unfair advantage by persisting with two or three
possibly fortuitous examples from a secondary subchapter; it might be better to
deal with parts less marginal to the work, closer to its center and its depth. Of
course. But the objection presupposes that we already know what the center and
the depth of the third Critique are, that we have already located its frame and
delimited its field. Yet nothing is more difficult to determine. The Critique is a
work (ergon) in several ways; as such, it must center and frame itself, delimit its
ground by distinguishing itself, by means of a frame, from a general background.
However this frame is problematic. I do not know what is essential and what is
secondary to a work. Above all I do not know what this thing is which is neither
essential nor secondary, neither proper nor improper, which Kant calls parergon,
for example, the frame. What is the place of the frame. Does it have a place. Where
does it begin. Where does it end. What is its inner limit. Outer. And the surface
between the two limits. I do not know if the passage in the Critique which defines
parergon is itself a parergon. Before deciding what is parergonal in a text which
poses the question of the parergon, we must know what a parergon is, at least if
one occurs in the text.
For my impatient critics, if they insist on seeing the thing itself: every
analytic of aesthetic judgment presupposes that we can rigorously distinguish
between the intrinsic and the extrinsic. Aesthetic judgment must concern intrinsic
beauty, and not the around and about. It is therefore necessary to know-this is
the fundamental presupposition, the foundation-how to define the intrinsic, the
framed, and what to exclude as frame and beyond the frame. We are thus already at
the unlocatable center of the problem. And since, when we ask, "What is a
frame?", Kant responds, "It is a parergon, a composite of inside and outside, but a
composite which is not an amalgam or half-and-half, an outside which is called
inside the inside to constitute it as inside." And when he gives as examples of the
26
The Parergon
parergon, besides the frame, drapery and columns, we say to ourselves that there
are indeed "considerable difficulties," and that the choice of examples, as well as
their association, is not self-evident.
All the more because the parergon, following the logic of the supplement,
divides into two. At the limit between the work and the absence of the work, it
divides into two. And this division gives rise to a sort of pathology of the parergon,
whose forms must be named and classified, just as Religion specified four types of
parergonal injuries or "prejudices." Kant is in effect in the process of defining "the
proper object of the pure judgement of taste." But he does not simply exclude the
parergon as such and in general. Only under certain conditions. Here the criterion
for exclusion is a formality.
What is meant by formality?
The parergon (frame, drapery, column) may augment the pleasure of taste
(Wohlgefallen des Geschmacks), may contribute to the intrinsically aesthetic
representation itself, if it intervenes by means of its form (durch seine Form), and
only by means of its form. If it has a "beautiful form," it enters into the judgment
of taste properly speaking, or in any case its intervention is essential. It is, if you
will, the normal parergon. But if, on the contrary, it is not beautiful, purely
beautiful, that is, formally beautiful, then it is mere finery (parure; Schmuck) and
tarnishes the beauty of the work, detracts from it and is unfair to it. It is the
analogue of the damage or "prejudice" (Nachteil) in Religion.
The example of the degradation into seductive finery of the simple parergon
is again the frame, this time the gilded frame (goldene Rahmen), the gilding on
the frame which calls our attention to the painting by means of its charm (Reiz).
What is bad, therefore, and external to the pure object of taste is that which
seduces by charm; and the example of that which diverts by means of its charm is a
color, gilding, as nonform, sensible content, or matter. The deterioration of the
parergon-the perversion, the allure-is the charm of sensible content. As
drawing, the arrangement of lines and formation of angles, the frame is not
alluring at all and is indispensable. But to retain its purity, it must remain
without color, free from all sensible, empirical materiality.
This opposition form/matter dominates, as we know, the Critique as a
whole, inscribing it within a powerful tradition. According to The Origin of the
Work of Art, it is one of three determinations (hypokeimenon/sumbe bekos,
aistheton/noeton, eidos-morphe/hyle) which encroach violently upon the thing.
It provides a "conceptual schema" (Begriffschema) for every theory of art. We need
only associate the rational within the formal, the irrational with matter, the latter
with illogic, the former with logic, to connect the ensemble to the subject/object
pair, to set up a Begriffsmechanic which nothing can withstand. But what is the
region of origin of this determination of the thing as informed matter? Its
wholesale usage by aesthetics allows us to conceive of an origin far beyond the
realm of art. And the Christian creation myth contributes an "additional impulse,"
a supplementary motivation to consider the form/matter complex as the
27
OCTOBER
structure of every entity, l'ens creatum as the unity of forma and materia. Faith
having disappeared, the schemata of Christian philosophy remain forceful. "Thus
the interpretation of 'thing' by means of matter and form, whether it remains
medieval or becomes Kantian-transcendental, has become current and self-evident.
But for that reason, no less than the other interpretations mentioned of the
thingness of the thing, it is an encroachment [Ueberfall] upon the thing-being of
the thing. This situation stands revealed as soon as we speak of things in the strict
sense as mere things [blosse Dinge, naked things]. The 'mere' [bloss], after all,
means the removal [Entblossung] of the character of usefulness and of being made.
The mere thing is a sort of equipment, albeit equipment denuded of its equipmental
being. Thing-being consists in what is then left over. But this remnant is not
actually defined in its ontological character ..." I
